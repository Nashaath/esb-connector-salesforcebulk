# Salesforce Bulk Connector

The SalesforceBulk [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to access the [SalesforceBulk REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_intro.htm) through WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI). SalesforceBulk is a RESTful API that allows you to either quickly load large sets of your organisation’s data into Salesforce or delete large sets of your organisation’s data from Salesforce. You can use SalesforceBulk to query, insert, update, upsert or delete a large number of records asynchronously, by submitting the records in batches. Salesforce can process these batches in the background.

## Getting started
To get started, go to [Configuring SalesforceBulk Operations](config.md). Once you have completed your configurations, you can perform various operations with the connector.
